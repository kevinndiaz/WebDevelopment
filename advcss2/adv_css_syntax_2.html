		   In 1903, Boston businessman Arioch Wentworth left the bulk of his estate, estimated at $7 million, for the purpose of founding an industrial school within the city. Accordingly, a board of seven directors incorporated Wentworth Institute on April 5, 1904, as a school "to furnish education in the mechanical arts." The directors spent several years investigating the educational needs of the community and increased the endowment — only $3.5 million at the time and reached a settlement with Wentworth's daughter, who had contested his will. — The campus was established in Boston's Back Bay Fens, and Arthur L. Williston was hired as the first principal of the college.

			On September 25, 1911, Wentworth opened its doors as a technical school to 242 students. The school quickly gained enrollment and by 1919, it had 1,800 students in day and evening programs and 45 teachers. In 1953, Wentworth named its first president, H. Russell Beatty. Wentworth became a degree-granting institution in 1957 and began awarding its first baccalaureate-level degrees in 1970. Wentworth changed from a commuter college to a residential campus in the 1960s with the addition of several residence halls.

			In 1972, the Institute admitted its first female students. By 2005, women represented 21% of the academic population. In 1975, cooperative education programs were introduced at Wentworth. In 1973, Wentworth instructors unionized to join the American Federation of Teachers and on October 28, 1977, the teachers of Wentworth went on strike. Before 1977, the college's lower and upper divisions operated as two separate schools; in that year these two schools merged and the Wentworth Institute of Technology was created. With admissions numbers growing, Wentworth expanded by acquiring the Ira Allen School building from the city of Boston in 1980 and the former Boston Trade High School in 1983.

			Major renovations to the third floor of Annex Hall were enacted in 1989 at a cost of $1 million to add architectural studios and facilities. After renovation, Wentworth gained accreditation from the National Architectural Accrediting Board in 1991. In 1993, Wentworth introduced a pair of five-year engineering programs to the curriculum: electromechanical engineering and environmental science. In 2002, these programs received initial accreditation from the Engineering Accreditation Commission.
